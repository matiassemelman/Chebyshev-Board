# Educational Visualizer for Minimum Paths in 8-Direction Boards

[Preview on Vercel](https://chebyshev-board.vercel.app/)
---

### 1 Â· Introduction

The challenge's goal is to build a **mini-web application** that explains, in a **visual and conceptual** way, how to calculate the **minimum number of steps** that a board piece (capable of moving in any of its 8 adjacent directions) needs to visit a series of given coordinates in order. The app will serve as an educational piece. The project will show separation of responsibilities through **Clean Architecture**.

### 2 Â· Objectives & Key Results ()

| Objective
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ðŸ’¡ **Conceptual**    Understand the 2D Chebyshev distance problem.
| ðŸš€ **Functional**    Graphically display the minimum path.
| ðŸ§© **Architectural**    Apply Clean Architecture end-to-end.

### 3 Â· Features

1. **Coordinate input** (editable list or JSON text).
2. **Dynamic board rendering** with initial position and visits.
3. **Real-time calculation** of minimum steps using the Chebyshev formula.
4. **Step list** text (e.g. âžœ NE, N, N).

### 4 Â· Summarized User Journey

1. User opens `/` â†’ sees empty form and board.
2. Pastes `[ (0,0), (1,2), (1,3) ]` â†’ `Calculate`.
3. Result: "Minimum steps = 3" + board with highlighted path.
4. Can edit the list â†’ UI updates instantly.

### 6 Â· Architecture (Clean)

```
src/
 â”œâ”€ domain/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ models/Coordinate.ts
 â”‚   â””â”€ services/PathCalculator.ts
 â”œâ”€ application/
 â”‚   â””â”€ usecases/CalculatePathUseCase.ts
 â”œâ”€ infrastructure/
 â”‚   â””â”€ persistence/LocalStoreRepository.ts

     â”œâ”€ components/CoordinateList.tsx
     â””â”€ pages/HomePage.tsx
```

Dependencies always **from outside to inside** (Presentation â†’ App â†’ Domain). Domain doesn't import anything external.

### 7 Â· Internationalization (i18n)

The application supports multiple languages through a session-based internationalization system:

- **Supported Languages:** Spanish (es) and English (en)
- **Features:**
  - Automatic browser language detection
  - Language selection modal on startup
  - Manual language switching through UI
  - All static texts and error messages are translated
  - Clean Architecture compliant implementation

**Tech Stack:**
- `i18next`
- `react-i18next`
- `i18next-browser-languagedetector`

**Implementation:**
```plaintext

â””â”€ locales/
   â”œâ”€ en/
   â”‚  â””â”€ translation.json
   â””â”€ es/
      â””â”€ translation.json
```
