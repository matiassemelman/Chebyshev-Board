# Educational Visualizer for Minimum Paths in 8-Direction Boards

[Preview on Vercel](https://chebyshev-board.vercel.app/)
---

### 1 Â· Introduction

The challenge's goal is to build a **mini-web application** that explains, in a **visual and conceptual** way, how to calculate the **minimum number of steps** that a board piece (capable of moving in any of its 8 adjacent directions) needs to visit a series of given coordinates in order. The app will serve as an educational piece. The project will show separation of responsibilities through **Clean Architecture**.

### 2 Â· Objectives & Key Results ()

| Objective
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ðŸ’¡ **Conceptual**    Understand the 2D Chebyshev distance problem.
| ðŸš€ **Functional**    Graphically display the minimum path.
| ðŸ§© **Architectural**    Apply Clean Architecture end-to-end.

---

### 3 Â· Features

1. **Coordinate input** (editable list or JSON text).
2. **Dynamic board rendering** with initial position and visits.
3. **Real-time calculation** of minimum steps using the Chebyshev formula.
4. **Step list** text (e.g. âžœ NE, N, N).
5. **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Explanations** - Click any movement step to get natural language explanations of why that move is optimal for Chebyshev distance.

### 4 Â· Summarized User Journey

1. User opens `/` â†’ sees empty form and board.
2. Pastes `[ (0,0), (1,2), (1,3) ]` â†’ `Calculate`.
3. Result: "Minimum steps = 3" + board with highlighted path.
4. Can edit the list â†’ UI updates instantly.

### 7 Â· Internationalization (i18n)

The application supports multiple languages through a session-based internationalization system:

- **Supported Languages:** Spanish (es) and English (en)
- **Features:**
  - Automatic browser language detection
  - Language selection modal on startup
  - Manual language switching through UI
  - All static texts and error messages are translated
  - Clean Architecture compliant implementation

**Tech Stack:**
- `i18next`
- `react-i18next`
- `i18next-browser-languagedetector`

**Implementation:**
```plaintext

### 8 Â· AI-Powered Step Explanations ðŸ¤–

Transform your learning experience with **intelligent, contextual explanations** for every movement step. The visualizer becomes an **interactive tutor** that explains the reasoning behind each optimal move using natural language.

#### **Product Experience:**
- **Click any step** from the generated path â†’ Get personalized explanations
- **Educational focus**: Explains *why* diagonal moves are smarter than separate steps
- **Beginner-friendly**: Uses simple language, no complex mathematical formulas
- **Multilingual**: Explanations adapt to your selected language (Spanish/English)

#### **Key Technical Implementation:**

**ðŸš€ Groq API Integration with Vercel AI SDK**
- **Model**: `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b` optimized for educational content
- **Reasoning extraction**: Advanced middleware extracts structured thinking from LLM responses
- **Smart prompting**: Context-aware prompts that include movement coordinates and direction type

**ðŸ’¾ Intelligent Caching System**
- **24-hour TTL**: Local cache prevents duplicate API calls for same movements
- **Clean Architecture**: Repository pattern maintains separation of concerns
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Cache failures don't affect core pathfinding functionality

**Example Interaction:**
```
Step 2: NE from (0,0) to (1,1)
â†“ Click for explanation â†“

"Think of this like a chess king that can move diagonally! Instead of taking
2 separate steps (right then up), this NE move gets you there in just 1 step.
It's the smart shortcut because diagonal moves cover both horizontal and
vertical distance simultaneously."
```
